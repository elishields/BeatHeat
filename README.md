# BEATHEAT

**BeatHeat** is a web app that:
	
	- receives queried terms (submitted via browser), 
	
	- searches youtube for the popularity of these terms (during past 3 months), 
	
	- and returns if the term is hot or not.

**Sprints**:
	
	1. Spin up a new Laravel web app.

	2. Hit the YouTube API with a query.
	
	3. Process the returned data.
	
	4. Return the data to a webpage.
	
	5. Deploy the app.
